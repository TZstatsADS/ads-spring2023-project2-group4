![screenshot](doc/figs/map.jpg)

In this second project of GR5243 Applied Data Science, we develop a *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* shiny app on the work of a **NYC government agency/program** of your choice using NYC open data released on the [NYC Open Data By Agency](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/data/) website. In particular, many agencies have adjusted their work or rolled out new programs due to COVID, your app should provide ways for a user to explore quantiative measures of how covid has impacted daily life in NYC from different prospectives. See [Project 2 Description](doc/project2_desc.md) for more details.  

The **learning goals** for this project is:

- business intelligence for data science
- data cleaning
- data visualization
- systems development/design life cycle
- shiny app/shiny server
